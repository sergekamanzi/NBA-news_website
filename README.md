Lightweight news website template for NBA coverage built with React and Vite. This project demonstrates a small, component-driven structure with client-side routing and simple styling.

Key goals:

- Provide a clean starting point for a sports news site (NBA-focused).
- Use modern React (hooks, component composition) with Vite for fast development.
- Keep the project small and easy to extend.

---

## Features

- React + Vite fast development server and build.
- Client-side routing with `react-router-dom`.
- HTTP requests ready via `axios` (placeholder for real APIs).
- Small, organized components: `Navbar`, `Contact`, `Authentications`, and pages for `Home`, `Events`, and `News & Updates`.
- ESLint configured for basic code quality checks.

## Tech stack

- React 19
- Vite
- react-router-dom
- axios
- react-icons
- ESLint

## Project structure (important files)

- `index.html` — HTML entry.
- `src/main.jsx` — App bootstrap and router mount.
- `src/App.jsx` — Top-level application component.
- `src/components/` — Reusable UI components and their styles.
	- `Authentications/` — auth UI components
	- `Contact/` — contact page component
	- `Navbar/` — navigation bar component
- `src/pages/` — page components (Home, Events, News & Updates).
- `public/` — static assets (images, icons).
- `package.json` — install scripts and dependencies.
- `vite.config.js` — Vite configuration.

## Installation

Make sure you have Node.js (v16+ recommended) installed.

1. Clone the repository or download the source.
2. From the project root, install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

## Available scripts

Run these from the project root.

- Start development server (Hot Module Replacement):

```powershell
npm run dev
```

- Build for production:

```powershell
npm run build
```

- Preview production build locally:

```powershell
npm run preview
```

- Run ESLint across the project:

```powershell
npm run lint
```

## How to use

1. Run the dev server (`npm run dev`).
2. Open the browser at the address shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
3. Explore the pages via the navbar. Replace placeholder content with real API calls or CMS data as needed.

## Environment and API notes

- The project includes `axios` for HTTP requests but does not include any live API keys or backend by default. When integrating a news API, keep secrets out of source control — use environment variables and a server-side proxy when required.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome. A simple workflow:

1. Fork or clone the repository.
2. Create a branch for your change (`feature/awesome` or `fix/typo`).
3. Make changes and run `npm run dev` to test.
4. Open a pull request with a clear description of your changes.

Please follow the existing code style. Run ESLint (`npm run lint`) before submitting.
